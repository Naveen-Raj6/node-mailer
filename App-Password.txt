🔑 What is an App Password?
 An App Password is a 16-character, randomly generated password created by Google.
 It is used only for apps (like Nodemailer) — you don’t type it anywhere else.
 It’s different from your main Gmail password.

Example: xqmrnvctzphxrytb (Google generates something like this).

🛠 How to create an App Password (for Gmail)

1.Log into your Google Account: myaccount.google.com
2.Go to Security (left menu).
3.Make sure 2-Step Verification (2FA) is turned ON.
    -If not, you’ll need to enable it (Google may ask you to link your phone).
4.After 2FA is on, you’ll see App passwords option below.
    -If you don’t see it → make sure you’re using a personal Gmail account, not a work/school account.
5.Click App passwords.
6.Under “Select app”, choose Mail.
7.Under “Select device”, pick your device (e.g. Windows, Other).
8.Click Generate.
9.Copy the 16-character password (Google shows spaces but ignore them).



📝 Save it in .env:-
Now, in your project folder, make a file called .env:
GMAIL_USER=youremail@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=the16charpassword

Flow (what happens behind the scenes)

Your Script
   │  (transporter + mailOptions)
   ▼
Nodemailer (SMTP Client)
   │
   │ TLS-encrypted connection (port 465) with your Gmail App Password
   ▼
Gmail SMTP server
   │
   │ Queues + processes the email
   ▼
Recipient’s mailbox (your Gmail inbox in this case 🎉)




Key Learnings:-

.env keeps secrets safe (never hard-code passwords in your repo).

transporter = the "mail pipe" (connection to Gmail SMTP).

mailOptions = the actual message (headers + body).

verify() = checks connection before sending.

sendMail() = sends it off to Gmail.

Gmail accepts or rejects → if accepted, delivery is handled by Gmail, not Nodemailer anymore.
